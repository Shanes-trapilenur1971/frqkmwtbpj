Duuude, just finished Cleaner and, wow, not sure what I was expecting, honestly. Did you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? It’s like... got this vibe where I’m torn between being totally invested and just super confused, you know? The protagonist, I mean he's a janitor, but somehow he’s cleaning up more than just, like, Cheeto dust. Also, can we talk about how every single room he walks into looks like it’s waiting to be an Instagram room tour? Totally unreal.

And the plot, omg, kept jumping around. One minute we’re dealing with mobsters, and I blink, and he's solving family issues. It’s like this mash-up of drama and suspense with a dash of awkward comedy, but maybe that’s kinda the charm? Who even thought mixing these vibes would work, but here we are, right?

> Oh, and get this - there’s a scene where he’s just talking to himself, you know, just one of those “phone’s gonna ring” moments, and bam! Plot twist-nado! So unpredictable yet still sorta fitting in?

I seriously laughed at the “mysterious briefcase” bit. Like, c'mon, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers, can we have something besides briefcases? It's always the same, but I still 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   like I was expecting something new. Honestly, I think I missed like 10% of the plot 'cause I was looking at my phone too, but who doesn't multitask these days? 😂

Also, when that one side character pops up outta nowhere and you’re like, “Who even is this dude?” and then they suddenly matter sooo much two scenes later — classic chaotic writing. It was like rolling all over the place, and the music switches! Lol, not even like a Spotify shuffle, more like a DJ trying to get through a glitchy set.

console.log(Why did I even add this line?);

Anyway, overall, I'm feeling both hyped and kinda lost, but that’s probably my fault for not paying 100% attention. Hit me up after you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, I need someone to confirm if it's just me or if this   was actually a fever dream.
